#### Summary:

I have master’s degree in sociology. But now I decide to change my profession. I started to learn programing by myself. It’s really interesting. I love to learn from anywhere. I have already taken several courses on the internet. I can say that I learn quickly. Math was my favorite subject at school, so it really helps me to learn programing now.
My short-term plan is to become front-end developer. But in long-term, I consider myself as a full-stack developer. 

#### Skills:
